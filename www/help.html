                <h3>What is PerSE?</h3>

                <p>PerSE (Periodicity in Spatiotemporal Events) is a web application to assist users in the detect and analysis
                    of periodicity within event data sets. PerSE attempts to tackle detection and analysis through sophisticated
                    aggregation and methods commonly used in the field of Visual Analytics</p>

                <p>PerSE was designed and built for human-related event data sets. For instance,
                    car-crash reports, crimes, terrorist acts, etc. Since human-related events are often interrelated
                    with culture, PerSE makes extensive use of the calendar to analyze event data.</p>

                <p>For more information on periodicity, calendars, and PerSE, please check out the
                    <a href="about.html">About</a> page.</p>

                <h3>How do I use this guide?</h3>

                <p>This guide is meant to be reference for PerSE users. If this is your first time using PerSE then it might
                    be a good idea to read through the Quick Start and consult the Views section for any remaining
                    questions. However if you like living on the edge, then go right ahead and start using PerSE, but
                    be sure to use a modern browser like Chrome (recommended), FireFox, Safari,
                    or Opera and desktop or laptop.</p>

        <p class="lead">Become familiar with PerSE.</p>

        <p>In this Quick Start guide I will walk you through the interface of the PerSE. I'll try to provide as
            many images as possible to illustrate what I am doing, but it may be helpful to experiment with it as
            you read this section.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind, I will only point out the major features of PerSE. For more information check out
            the Views section on this page. In that section each view will have a sub-section where it will be
            discussed in detail.</p>

        <p>Lets begin!</p>

        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-getting-started" data-title="Getting Started">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Getting Started</h3>

                <p>Before we attempt to access PerSE, you will need to have an updated version of a
                    modern browser like Chrome (recommended), Firefox, Safari, or Opera. Chrome is
                    the recommended browser because its the one that was used to develop PerSE. Do NOT use IE,
                    this is because IE doesn't jive well with a few of the core libraries used PerSE,
                    namely <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a>.</p>

                <p>Also, PerSE was developed to be used on a desktop or laptop. In case you are
                    using any other device be aware that operations will not be supported.</p>

                <p>PerSE comes with a built-in data set, meaning the data automatically loads into the browser
                    before you can even see the interface. So technically you can do analysis right now by following
                    the link to <a href="index.html">PerSE</a></p>

                <p>After clicking the link, you will see a modal dialog with the words, "Loading...", and all the
                    data and code will be loaded into your browser within 2-3 seconds.</p>

        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-qs-voronoi-supplots-map" data-title="Voronoi Subplots Map">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Voronoi Subplots Map</h3>

                <p>The Voronoi Subplots Map is the largest <em>view</em> in PerSE. A view
                    is simply a visible top level component of the app. Some people call them widgets, charts, plots,
                    visualizations, etc, but I will refer to them as a view. This view gets it's name from being the
                    mix of two different methods: Small Multiples and Voronoi Diagram.</p>

                <p>The Voronoi Subplots Map can be used to detect and analyze periodicity at multiple scales
                    through user interaction. The map displays selected events based on their
                    latitude and longitude. You will also notice that events have different colors. These colors
                    are currently based on the event's <strong>Event Type</strong> attribute. These colors are also r
                    reflected in all the other views. You can click events on the map to get a popup with the
                    event's description.</p>

                <p>If you brush the mouse over the map you will notice semi-transparent white boundaries on the map
                    will highlight. These are the voronoi diagram cells. Furthermore, you will also notice a light
                    disk-shaped circle within each boundary. These are the voronoi diagram seeds.<p>

                <p>In addition the voronoi cell boundaries highlighting on being brushed by the mouse, you will also
                    see one of the subplots along the side of the map highlighting. The highlighted subplot displays
                    data points located within the boundary of the voronoi cell. These subplots are positioned to be
                    close to their respective seed coordinate.</p>

                <p>Subplots always plotted with the same scale to prevent misleading values. If you hover the mouse
                    over an arc within one of the subplots two things happen. First, the data on the map will be
                    filtered by that attribute. Second, all subplots are dynamically link so that a
                    hover in one is identical to a hover in all other subplots. This means that you can see the
                    actual data point value in all other subplots. Keep in mind the subplots do not perform any
                    filter beyond the Voronoi Subplots Map.</p>

                <p>You can change the subplots settings with
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button> and their calendar with
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>.</p>

                <p>Voronoi cells can be altered with <strong>Add</strong>,
                    <strong>Move</strong>, and <strong>Remove</strong> in
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>.
                    You can also filter events by their location with a spatial polygon with
                    <strong>Draw</strong>, <strong>Modify</strong>, and <strong>Move</strong> in
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>.</p>

                <p>You will be able to tell if a view is filtering the data set by the filter button.
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                    means it is filter;
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs disabled" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                    means it is NOT filtering.</p>

                <p>To remove a filter on <strong>any</strong> view, simply click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>.</p>

            </div>

        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-qs-main-toolbar" data-title="Main Toolbar">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Main Toolbar</h3>

                <p>The Main Toolbar is a convenience toolbar used for syncing all views. This special toolbar is
                    located near top left of PerSE. This toolbar also displays some common features within PerSE.</p>

                <p>When PerSE starts-up all views are synced to one calendar. However, over the course of analysis,
                    you may decide to display one view in Gregorian and another other in Islamic. To sysnc all the
                    views back to one calendar click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                    on the Main Toolbar, and then click your desired calendar.</p>

                <p>At some point during analysis you may wish to clear all filters within PerSE. This essentially
                    resets the entire interface. To do so click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                    on the Main Toolbar. This will tell all views to stop filtering. </p>

            </div>

        </div>


        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-qs-attribute-view" data-title="Attribute View">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Attribute View</h3>

                <p>The Attribute View is a space-saving view because you can change which attribute you want to
                    visualize by clicking the <span class="caret"></span> on the Toolbar title. Currently, you can
                    view three different attributes in the Attribute View:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event Type:</strong> The type of event. Also used to symbolize all other views.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actor:</strong> The acting group or persons in the event; the predicate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fatalities:</strong> Amount of deaths.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Attribute View handles an attribute in one of two ways: <em>numerical</em> and
                    <em>non-numerical</em>.</p>

                <p><em>Numerical</em> attributes like <strong>Fatalities</strong> are visualized with a histogram. You
                    can create a filter on the histogram by clicking by pushing the left mouse
                    button down and holding it, dragging the mouse across the histogram,
                    and then releasing the mouse button.</p>

                <p><em>Non-numerical</em> attribute like <strong>Event-Type</strong> and <strong>Actor</strong> are
                    displayed as a Bar Plots. Events are binned by unique values and symbolized
                    as bars based on count (i.e. frequency) of events. You can create a filter on the bar plot by
                    clicking individual bars on the bar plot. Sometimes there can be a lot of unique
                    values, like with the <strong>Actor</strong> attribute, so this plot is scrollable.</p>

            </div>

        </div>


        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-qs-time-wheel" data-title="Time-Wheel">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Time-Wheel</h3>

                <p>The Time-Wheel is a compact visualization for displaying cyclical units of the calendar. There
                    are three rings on the Time-Wheel:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Outer:</strong> Aggregates all selected events by day of month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Aggregates all selected events month of year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inner:</strong> Aggregates all selected events by day of week.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When an arc is hovered, labels are displayed in the top right corner of the view to provide
                    information on the calendar unit and the frequency (i.e. count) of events.</p>

                <p>You can create a filter with this view by left mouse clicking on any of the arcs within the ring.
                    To remove the filter click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>.</p>

                <p>To change the calendar represented click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                    in the view's toolbar, and select a calendar.</p>

            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-qs-timeline" data-title="Timeline">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Timeline</h3>

                <p>The Timeline displays the linear aspects of time within the data set by displaying events in
                    chronological order. The Timeline's x-axis is fixed, and spans from the floor date to ceiling date
                    (i.e. oldest to youngest).</p>

                <p>Events within the timeline are aggregated based on a calendar unit set within
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>.
                    Those parameters are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Year:</strong> Aggreagte events by the calendar year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Month:</strong> Aggregate events by the calendar month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Week:</strong> Aggregate events by the calendar week. (Default)</li>
                    <li><strong>Day:</strong> Aggregate events by the calendar day.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can create a range filter with this view by pressing the left mouse
                    button down and holding it, dragging the mouse across the histogram,
                    and then releasing the left mouse button.</p>

                <p>Much like all the other views, mouse hover labels are displayed in the top right corner,
                    the calendar can be changed with
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"

                    and the filter can be removed by clicking
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter"

                <h3>Table</h3>

                <p>Below the <a href="#subgroup-qs-timeline">Timeline</a> you will see a table filled with events.
                    This table displays selected events much like all the other views, however it doesn't do
                    anything special to visualize them and it does not provide any filtering capability. It's only
                    duty is to display the raw data in chronological order.</p>

                <p>The table only shows 25 events at a time. To see the next 25 selected events click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>.
                    To see the previous selected events click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>.</p>

                <p>You can also click
                    <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span></button> to change
                    the calendar in which the date is displayed.</p>

                <p>Although the Table is primitive, can be fairly useful. Next time you find an interesting pattern
                    or finding, drill down on it with all the views and then look at the table to connect the dots.</p>

                <p>Well, this is the end of the Quickstart Guide. If you have any questions about any questions about
                    the views within PerSE check out the section on this page titled <a href="#group-views">Views</a>.
                    In that section, I'll go over each top level view in much greater detail,
                    including some background information, interactions, buttons, etc.</p>

                <p>Since PerSE uses buttons quite a bit, I also created a visual index for the buttons. This can be
                    found in the section on this page titled <a href="#group-buttons">Buttons</a>.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions about the PerSE as a whole, for instance, technology used to build it,
                    license, why it was developed, etc., you should check out the <a href="about.html">About</a>

        <div class="page-header"><h2>Views</h2></div>

        <p class="lead">An in depth description of PerSE's views.</p>

        <p>Before we start, what is a <strong>view</strong>? A <strong>view</strong> is simply a visible component of the
            app. Some people call them widgets, charts, plots, visualizations, etc, but we will refer to them as views.
            PerSE has a total of six top level views:</p>

        <ol type="A">
            <li><a href="#subgroup-views-attribute-view">Attribute View</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subgroup-views-main-toolbar">Main Toolbar</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subgroup-views-table">Table</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subgroup-views-timeline">Timeline</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subgroup-views-time-wheel">Time-Wheel</a></li>
            <li><a href="#subgroup-views-voronoi-subplots-map">Voronoi Subplots Map</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the following sections I'll go over these top level views in detail. If you are brand new to PerSE
            or are looking for a brief introduction I recommend the Quickstart Guide.</p>

        <section class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-views-attribute-view" data-title="Attribute View">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Attribute View</h3>

                <p class="lead">A space saving view that displays non-required attributes.</p>

                <p>The Attribute View can consists of 0 or more plots/charts for visualizing non-require data
                    attributes. Each non-required data set attribute can filter the data set independent of any other
                    view or attribute. The built in data set has three non-required data attributes.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event Type:</strong> The type of event recorded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actor:</strong> The acting group or persons in the event; the predicate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fatalities:</strong> Amount of deaths.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Since PerSE is crunched for screen space, you can only visualize one attribute in the Attribute View
                    at a time. To change the attribute in the Attribute view click the <span class="caret"></span> on
                    the Attribute View's toolbar title. You will then be able to select one of the three non-required
                    data attributes:</p>

                <p>After selecting a new attribute the current Attribute View will change to reflect the
                    newly selected attribute.</p>

                <p>Although there are many differnt types of data (i.e. nominal, ordinal, etc.), the Attribute
                    currently handles an attribute in one of two ways: numerical and non-numerical. These are
                    explained in the following paragraphs.</p>


                <div class="row" id="subgroup-views-attribute-numerical">

                    <div class="col-xs-12">

                        <h4>Numerical</h4>

                        <p>If all attribute values are numerical, then an attribute is determined to be a numerical
                            attribute, and will be displayed as a histogram. To illustrate this click the
                            <span class="caret"></span> on the Attribute Views toolbar title and select
                            <strong>Fatalities</strong>. The view will display a histogram of the
                            <strong>Fatalities</strong> attribute.</p>

                        <p>Histogram binning is automatically determined by an internal algorithm.</p>

                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="row" id="subgroup-views-attribute-non-numerical">

                    <div class="col-xs-12">

                        <h4>Non-Numerical</h4>

                        <p>If not all attribute values are numerical, then the attribute is determined to be a
                            Non-numerical attribute, and will be displayed as a Bar Plot. Events are binned by all
                            possible unique values and symbolized as horizontal rectangles based on count (frequency)
                            of events.</p>

                        <p>Since each unique value is assigned a rectangle and there could be a large amount of unique
                            values (the <strong>Actor</strong> attribute has +100 unique values), this plot is
                            scrollable. You can scroll the plot using the mouse wheel or the scroll bar.</p>

                    </div>

                </div>


                <div class="row" id="subgroup-views-attribute-filter">

                    <div class="col-xs-12">

                        <h4>Filter</h4>

                        <h5>Numerical</h5>

                        <p>Numerical attributes can perform range filtering on the data set through user interaction.
                            For example, select all events with reported <strong>Fatalities</strong> of 10 to 50.</p>

                        <p>To filter a Numerical attribute hover the mouse over the histogram, press the left mouse
                            button down and hold it, drag the mouse across the histogram, and then release the mouse. You should
                            see a gray box during this procedure, but after you release the mouse the plot will scale
                            to the selected range.</p>

                        <p>There are two ways to remove a filter on the histogram. Like all the other views you can remove
                            the active filter by clicking
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, or you can single click anywhere on the histogram.</p>

                        <h5>Non-Numerical</h5>

                        <p>Non-numerical attributes can filter the data set by selecting or deselecting unique
                            attribute values through user interaction. For example, select all events with reported
                            <strong>Actor</strong> of "Boko Haram".</p>

                        <p>The horizontal bar chart can perform attribute filtering on the data set by single clicking
                            individual bars with the left mouse button.</p>

                        <p>As mentioned above, sometimes there can be a large amount of unique values
                            for an attribute. In these situations, it is difficult to drill down on an attribute value.
                            For instance, to select only "Boko Haram" <strong>Actor</strong> events would require us to
                            single click +100 rectangles. Therefore, you can click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                            to clear/deselect all unique values for the plot, and then select the few values you
                            are interested in. For instance, now to select only "Boko Haram" <strong>Actor</strong>
                            events you can click <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle" aria-hidden="true"></span></button> to clear all
                            events in the plot, and then click "Boko Haram" to view only "Boko Haram" events.</p>

                <p class="lead">Primitive, but surprisingly useful...</p>

                <p>The Table is located below the Timeline and can be used to provide context regarding currently
                    selected events (i.e. events that pass every filtering view). Events are displayed as rows,
                    with 25 rows displayed at a time, and each row is given a background color to indicate their
                    attribute value (i.e. in the current data set this attribute is <em>Event Type</em>). Furthermore,
                    the table always sorts data in chronological order.</p>

                <p>The Table is most useful for used to verifying or examine findings. To verify an interesting

                <p>Future efforts will be made to make this table more like a <em>shoebox</em> so that users can store and

                <p>The arcs within the ring represent the calendar units (i.e. days within a month, months within a

                    calendar unit.</p>

                <p>When an arc is hovered, labels are displayed in the top right corner of the view to provide

                <h3>Voronoi Subplots Map</h3>

                <p class="lead">A map + subplots backed by an adjustable voronoi diagram.</p>

                <p>The Voronoi Subplots Map is the main view within PerSE. This view is used to detect where and to what
                    extent periodicity exists by combining two well know visualization methods: the voronoi diagram
                    and small multiples.</p>

                <p>There are two distinct components within this view: a map and a set of plots that sit on top of
                    the map called "subplots". In the following sections we will go over the voronoi diagram,
                    small multiple, and the map and subplots used in PerSE.</p>

                        <h4>Voronoi Diagram</h4>
                        <p>A voronoi diagram is diagram that shows the neighborhood of points, called seeds. To visualize the
                            neighborhood boundaries are created where it is equal distance from one seed to it's neighbor.
                            Therefore, every point within a polygon is nearest-neighbors to the polygon's seed.</p>
                        <p>A voronoi diagram is a diagram that partitions a surface based on a set of seeds or
                            points and their nearness/distance to each other. Each seed forms a polygon where everything
                            within is closer its respective seed than to any other seed. Polygon boundaries indicate the
                            location where it is equal distance to neighboring seeds.</p>
                        <p>The Voronoi Subplots in PerSE uses a voronoi diagram to determine what data points go to which plot.
                            This can be useful in situations where boundaries are fuzzy or unknown such as where periodicity
                            exists.</p>

                        <h4>Small Multiples</h4>
                        <p>Small Multiples are a set of same/similar charts, plots, or gylphs at the same scale, and it
                            primarily used for comparison. For more information on this method check out Edward Tufte's
                            <em>Envisioning Information</em> (1990).</p>
                        <p>The Voronoi Subplots use the small multiple visualization method with the help of a voronoi
                            diagram. The underlying voronoi diagram is used to aggregate data points based on their location,
                            and these collections of data points are plotted on charts that support reasoning about
                            periodicity. In order link the plots back to the map, PerSE uses positions the plot on the edge
                            of the map near its respective seed on the edge.</p>

                        <h4>Map</h4>
                        <p>The map displays selected events based on their latitude and longitude and colors them ba
                            sed on a specified attribute. In the case of our built
                            in data set on Nigeria, the map colors events by their Event-Type (i.e. Violence against
                            civilians, Battle no change in territory, etc.) If you hover over these events and
                            single-click the left mouse button, you will see a popup that displays a brief description
                            of the event.

                        <p>As mentioned above, this view makes use of a voronoi diagram. If you brush the mouse over the map you
                            will notice that semi-transparent white boundaries on the map will highlight. These are
                            the voronoi diagram cells. Furthermore, you will also notice a light disk-shaped circle within
                            each boundary. These are the voronoi diagram seeds.<p>

                        <h4>Voronoi Seeds</h4>

                        <p>In addition the voronoi cell boundaries highlighting on mouse brushes, you will also
                            see one of the subplots along the side of the map highlighting. The highlighted subplot displays
                            data points within the boundary of the voronoi cell. These subplots are positioned to be close
                            to their respective seed coordinate.</p>

                        <h5>Remove</h5>

                        <p>PerSE starts-up with six voronoi seeds on the map. Sometimes six can be to many, especially if
                            there are few data points or if we want to compare less the six regions. If this is the case we can
                            get rid of a voronoi seed by clicking
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then select <strong>Remove</strong>. Afterward you should see the seeds
                            highlighted. If you click one of the seeds the chart will eliminate the seed and its respective
                            subplot, and recalculate the voronoi diagram.</p>

                        <h5>Add</h5>

                        <p>If you have less than six voronoi seeds on the map, then you can add a voronoi seed in a similiar
                            way. First click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then select <strong>Add</strong>. Afterward your cursor should light up on
                            the map hinting that you can add a voronoi seed. If you click on the map, within the
                            extent of the data points, a voronoi seed and its respective subplot will be placed on the map, and
                            the voronoi diagram will recalculate.</p>

                        <h5>Positioning</h5>

                        <p>If you have been following the quick start up until now you will have noticed that the voronoi seeds
                            always snap to a gridded position. This is because the <em>Positioning</em> setting in
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            is set to <strong>Auto</strong>. <strong>Auto</strong> can be a nice setting because it attempts to
                            figure out the best position for the voronoi seeds every time the selection changes. Therefore,
                            if the only points on the map were in the South-West corner then the voronoi seeds would try to
                            grid the South-West corner.</p>

                        <p>What if you want more control over the voronoi seeds? Well, you can by changing the positioning to
                            to <strong>Manual</strong>. To do that click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then select <strong>Manual</strong>. Now voronoi seeds will not reposition
                            when the selection changes. If you would like to move the voronoi seed click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then select <strong>Move</strong>. This will allow you to move a
                            voronoi seed along with its respective subplot around the map. After you move the seed the
                            voronoi diagram will recalculate and the voronoi seeds respective subplot will reposition to a
                            better docking station if the layout permits.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:right;"><small>**Note, <strong>Move</strong> is only enabled when
                            <em>Positioning</em> is set to <strong>Manual</strong>.</small></p>

                        <h5>Reset</h5>

                        <p>At some point during analysis you may want to revert back to the default voronoi seeds. To do
                            this click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-record" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and select the <strong>Reset</strong>. By doing so, voronoi seeds will be added
                            to the map until it reaches the maximum seeds (six). Then the seeds and their respective plots
                            will be repositioning into a gridded layout similar to <strong>Auto</strong> <em>Positioning
                            </em>. Finally, the subplots will update with the newly aggregated data.
                        </p>

                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="row" id="subgroup-voronoi-subplots-map-subplots">

                    <div class="col-xs-12">

                        <h4>Subplots</h4>

                        <p>As mentioned above the subplots display event data derived from their respective voronoi cell. Each
                            subplot is linked to all other subplots. Meaning, if you hover over an aggregate in one
                            subplot, it will simulate the same hover in all the other subplot. The details for each
                            hover are labeled in the top right corner of the subplot. This type of labeling is
                            mirrored in all the top level views too.</p>

                        <p>The map is also linked to the subplots. Event points not associated with
                            the hovered aggregate of the subplot will disappear on subplot hovering. Despite the
                            dynamic linking on mouse hovers and brushes, this action has no filtering
                            capabilities outside of the Voronoi Subplots Map.</p>

                        <p>There are two types of subplots in the Voronoi Subplots Map: <strong>Time-Wheel</strong> (default)
                            and <strong>Line Plot</strong>. To change the <em>Plot Type</em> click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chart" aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar and select either <strong>Time-Wheel</strong> or
                            <strong>Line Plot</strong>.</p>

                        <h5>Time-Wheel</h5>

                        <p>The Time-Wheel is a useful for visualizing cyclical units of time. Each ring around the
                            plot is segmented by arcs which represent a common calendar aggregates. For example, Day
                            of the Month, Month of the Year, Day of the Week. Each ring aggregates all selected
                            events by their date.</p>

                        <p>The Time-Wheels in the Voronoi Subplots Map are almost exactly the same as the one in the
                            top level view, however there are some small differences. The Time-Wheels in the
                            Voronoi Subplots Map cannot filter outside of the Voronoi Subplots Map,
                            meaning they are not "clickable". Second, since these plots are all linked,
                            they place a burden on the DOMs rendering capabilites. Thus,
                            they do not transition as smoothly as the top level view Time-Wheel.</p>

                        <h5>Line-Plot</h5>

                        <p>The Line Plot is useful for visualizing the linear aspects cyclical units. Each line is
                            a temporal segment (e.g. day, month, week) determined by a cycle length (e.g. month of
                            year, day of week). Lines are given a Y-value based on the count/frequency of
                            events that took place during the temporal segment.</p>

                        <p>You may change the cycle length for all Line Plots within the Voronoi Subplots Map by
                            clicking
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats" aria-hidden="true"><span
                                        class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            in the toolbar, and then selecting and option within the <em>Cycle</em> section.</p>

                        <h5>Change Calendar</h5>

                        <p>Like most of the top level views in PerSE, the Voronoi Subplots Map allows you to change the
                            calendar used to aggregate events. To change the calendar click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar" aria-hidden="true"><span
                                        class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar and select one of the calendar systems. After you have changed the calendar, the
                            subplots in the Voronoi Subplots Map will re-aggregate the data with the new calendar.</p>

                        <p>In addition for periodicity detection and analysis, the Voronoi Subplots Map can also be used to
                            perform spatial filters on the entire data set. To create a spatial filter first click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then click <strong>Draw</strong>. Much like adding a voronoi seed, your
                            cursor will highlight on the map, and you will be able to draw a polygon by clicking to plot a
                            vertex. To end a drawing session double click or single click the starting vertex. After a
                            polygon is created PerSE will filter the entire data set based on the boundaries of the newly
                            created polygon. Note, at this time PerSE only supports one filtering polygon.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Modify</h5>

                        <p>If you would like to change the boundary of a spatial filter polygon click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then click <strong>Modify</strong>. You will notice that the spatial filter
                            polygon becomes highlighted, and your mouse cursor will snap to the boundary when near. To modify
                            the spatial filter polygon drag a boundary vertex or edge to the desired location. You can also
                            remove a vertex by single clicking the vertex.</p>

                        <h5>Move</h5>

                        <p>If you would like to move the spatial filter polygon (i.e. change coordinates, but preserve the
                            geometry and orientation.), click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and click <strong>Move</strong>. Much like <strong>Modify</strong> you will
                            notice that the spatial filter polygon becomes highlighted and when you hover over it your cursor
                            will turn into move-arrows. To move the spatial filter polygon hover over the spatial filter
                            polygon, press-and-hold mouse button down, and drag it to the desired location. When you release
                            the mouse button the spatial filter polygon will fix to that location, and the entire data set
                            will update with the new filter.</p>

                        <h5>Remove</h5>
                        <p>There are two ways to remove a spatial filter polygon. The easiest of the two is to simply click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar. After you click this button the spatial filter polygon will be removed from the
                            map, and the Vornoi Subplots Map will reset. Also note the button will look like this
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs disabled" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            because there the Voronoi Subplots Map is not filtering the data set. This mechanism is the same
                            on all other top level views in PerSE.</p>

                        <p>The long way to remove a spatial fitler polygon is to click
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs disabled" style="pointer-events:none;" type="button">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"
                              aria-hidden="true"><span class="caret"></span></span></button>
                            on the toolbar, and then click <strong>Remove</strong>. This performs the exact same function as
                            the above method, but was included in this drop-down because it naturally fits there.</p>

                                                The Time-Wheel is plot that displays the data in the form
                                                of a wheel. This is useful for displaying the cyclical aspects of
                                                temporal data. Data points are binned by their respective temporal
                                                aggregate (i.e. Month of Year, Day of Week). As multiple cycles are

                                            <li><strong>Line Plot:</strong> Change all subplots to a Line Plot.
                                                The Line Plot is a plot that displays the data in the form
                                                of a line where each line is an temporal segment determined by a cycle
                                                length (i.e. month of year, day of week). This can be useful for
                                                visualizing individual, rather than viewing all of them like in
                                                the Time-Wheel.</li>
