    <div class="page-header"><h2>Data</h2></div>

    <p class="lead">PerSE is driven by event data. It's currently set up to visualize a subset of the
        <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>.</p>

    <div class="subgroup" id="subgroup-representation">
        <h3>Representation</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above, PerSE was built and developed to visualize
            <em>event</em>
            periodicity from the lens of local calendar systems. As accounting for all
            events would be a highly complicated, this project currently represents them as:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>having a duration of less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>points.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>PerSE does not anticipate any other data, however the system allows for the user to add additional
        data attributes. These additional attributes are determined by PerSE to be either numerical or
        categorical. If numerical the attribute is visualized as a histogram; if categorical the
        attribute is visualized as a bar plot.</p>

    <p>There are two special types of additional attributes that a user may specify:</p>

    <div class="subgroup" id="subgroup-datarequirements">

        <h3>Data Requirements</h3>

        <p>PerSE has two data requirements, and two optional:</p>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>Location</dt>
            <dd>Latitude and Longitude in decimal degree format.</dd>
            <dt>Date</dt>
            <dd>A date/time stamp in the Gregorian format.</dd>
            <dt>Context Attribute</dt>
            <dd>(Optional) Used to symbolize all views. If not stated all views display data as solid
                gray. Note, it is not recommend to have more than 9, and as of now can only accept
                categorical attributes. (e.g. event type, actor type)
            </dd>
            <dt>Description</dt>
            <dd>(Optional) Used to add detail and other meaningful information to the event. The Description
                is visualized within the table. (e.g. title of article used to code the event, notes of the
                event)
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

    <div class="subgroup" id="subgroup-acled">
        <h3>ACLED</h3>

        <p>This project utilizes the <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED (Armed Conflict
            Location and Event Data Project)</a>. The ACLED contains data points which detail reported
            political violence in developing states. Data point attributes include, event type, actors,
            associate actors, interaction, fatalities, source, location, location precision, and notes. As
            event coding can be a complicated and controversial thing, please feel free to check out their
            <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">website</a> for more details.</p>

        <p>As the <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a> contains >90,000 data points spanning the
            Africa and the Middle East, PerSE uses a subset of this data set
            to illustrate the potential utility of the tool. The subset currently displayed in PerSE spans
            from 01 JAN 2008 to 2013 DEC 2013 in Nigeria, which contains 3,296 data points. This data set
            was chosen because it highlights the complexity in culturally derived periodicity. In the
            case of Nigeria, the North is distinctly Islamic, and therefore the Islamic (Hijri) calendar
            is important; the South is distinctly Christian, and therefore the Gregorian calendar is
            important.</p>

        <p>Although PerSE utilizes the <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>, PerSE does not
            attempt to be a comprehensive solution for <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>
            analysis. Important aspects within the data set like actor-to-actor correlations are not
            explicitly addressed at its current state. Perhaps this would be a useful follow-up project.</p>

    <div class="page-header"><h2>Technology</h2></div>

    <p class="lead"><a href="index.html">PerSE</a> is 99.9% on the client, and was built with several web
        development libraries and toolkits.</p>

    <p>PerSE is 99.9% client side programming. In fact, after all dependencies load, the only server
        request is for map tiles. In the age of <em>Big-Data</em> this may
        sound unusual, however keep in mind PerSE is a prototype designed and built to advance current
        research on visual analytics methods for spatio-temporal periodicity. Therefore, the emphasis is
        placed on he visual components.</p>

    <div class="subgroup" id="subgroup-modularity">

        <h3>Modularity</h3>

        <p>The project was also written carefully to insure as much modularity as possible. To help
            with this process development focused on the
            <a ref="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD">Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)</a>
            paradigm. That way views could be refactored into other projects.</p>

        <p>For instance, each view... <p>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dd>... loads it's required dependencies.</dd>
            <dd>... is given an identical array of data points every time the selection changes.</dd>
            <dd>... provides a filter function to the data set adapter to filter data points.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>As a result, PerSE can endured <strong>change</strong> with relatively low impact. This
            will be particularly important if the data set operations and processing are offloaded to a
            server.<p>

    </div>

    <div class="subgroup" id="subgroup-dependencies">

        <h3>Dependencies</h3>

        <p>Below is a list of the libraries and toolkits used:</p>

                calendar support</li>

    <div class="page-header"><h2>Future Work</h2></div>

    <p class="lead">Some future work include, actor-to-actor correlations, scaling up to a server,
        irregular interval periodicity.</p>

    <p>There are many future work ideas that could be implemented in PerSE. To name a few:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Actor-to-Actor</strong>: How can we visualize this? How can we see who is
            battling/targeting who? When and Where?</li>
        <li><strong>Verification</strong>: After we find a pattern, how can we verify it with
            statistical tests?</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling Up</strong>: As mentioned above, everything is done on the client. If we
            move some or all of the preprocessing to a server we will be able to access larger data sets.
            However, if we scale up in events, we will need to look into alternative mapping solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Irregular Patterns</strong>: PerSE was built to answer question about formal
            calendar systems (i.e. Gregorian, Islamic, etc.). What about patterns that don't fit any
            calendar system (i.e. 10-day patterns, 21-day patterns)?</li>
        <li><strong>Holiday Support</strong>: Patterns related to a calendar system might be in
            relation civic, religious, or cultural holidays. By identifying the root of these patterns
            we can understand more complex issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Export</strong>: Analysts will most likely want to export data for further
            analysis. A <em>shoebox</em> extension to the table would facilitate this process.</li>
    </ul>
