        <p class="lead">PerSE is a visual analytics web application to assist in periodicity detection and
            analysis.</p>


        <p>PerSE is a web application designed and built to aid users in the detection and analysis of periodicity within event data sets. Hence, PerSE stands for "Periodicity in Spatio-temporal Events". PerSE attempts to tackle detection and analysis through sophisticated aggregation and methods commonly used in the field of Visual Analytics.</p>

        <p>The main idea behind PerSE is that different groups of people use different calendars systems, for instance, Gregorian, Islamic (Hijri), Hebrew, and Persian. Therefore, we should analyze event data sets (e.g. car-crashs, crimes, terrorist acts, and etc.) through the lens of the calendar system relative to the communities and areas of interest.</p>

        <p>PerSE is composed of several crossfiltering views: the Voronoi Subplots Map, Main Toolbar, Attribute View, Time-Wheel, Timeline, and Table. To detect and analyze periodicity within event data sets, users must use the mouse to interactively set and release filters on one or more of the views.</p>

                <h3>What is periodicity?</h3>

                <p>Periodicity is a tendency of something to repeat in regular intervals. If we examine our own lives we see that much of our behavior is periodic. Broadly speaking, we wake up in the morning, we don't work on Saturday and Sunday, we are more active outdoors during the warm months, and less active in cold months. Other examples:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Traffic becomes congested during the weekday at 5:00pm.</li>
                    <li>Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp XYZ may receive food aid on Fridays.</li>
                    <li>Muslims fast during the Islamic month of Ramadan.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, periodicity is very tricky because it is bounded by three factors:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Space:</strong> Periodicity may only exists within the geographic boundary (e.g. traffic is only congested within highly urban areas).</li>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> Periodicity may be a temporary (e.g. IDP camp XYZ exists for N amount of days, therefore food aid ceases to be distributed on Fridays).</li>
                    <li><strong>Attribute:</strong> Periodicity may only exists given a conditional attribute (e.g. Only Muslims fast during the Islamic month of Ramadan).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If there is only one bounding factor, periodicity may be easy to identify. In real world data sets this is often not the case. So, we must use special techniques and tools to identify periodicity.</p>

                <h3>Why does the calendar matter?</h3>

                <p>A calendar is a manmade tool used to gauge time. There are many calendars; just to name a few calendar systems: the Gregorian, Islamic (Hijra), Persian, Hebrew, Coptic, Chinese, Thai, and Ethiopian. As of 2015 almost all countries in the world use the Gregorian calendar. However, the Gregorian calendar's dominance does not mean that the other calendars have become extinct. In fact, many calendars are still used to mark important cultural and religious happenings.</p>

                <p>If we ignore the calendar, then we ignore any linking contextual information. Therefore, we must analyze the human event data sets through the lens of calendars native to the areas of interest.</p>

                <h3>Why PerSE?</h3>

                <p>PerSE's main strength is that it backs human reasoning with sophisticated aggregation methods and date conversion. Thus, periodicity detection and analysis becomes more accesible to the end user.</p>

                <p>PerSE also presents event data in a transparent interface, meaning there is no <em>black-box</em> or <em>magic</em>. Events are simply aggregated based on a wide variety filters and settings.</p>

                <p>This project contends that human reasoning assisted by an interactive interface and sophisticated aggregation methods can unveil truths about periodicity within event data sets.</p>

                <p>You can check out <a href="index.html">PerSE</a> right now! Each view, except the table, has the ability to filter the data set through user interaction. After a filter is added, changed, or removed, all views will display events that suffice every filter. All views are currently colored based on the <strong>Event Type</strong> attribute.</p>

        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-representation" data-title="Representation">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Representation</h3>

                <p>An <em>event</em> is a very loosely defined word that is highly dependent on spatial and temporal scale. For instance, an event could be anything from a minor scrimmage between the Allies and the Axis to the entire World War II. Accounting for all events would be highly complicated. Therefore, PerSE makes two assumptions about all data points.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Events viewed in PerSE have a duration of less than 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>Events viewed in PerSE can be represented/symbolized as points.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This representation certainly has it's flaws, but many exciting events can justifiably be represented with the above simplification. Extending the application to fit a broader spectrum of events is not the current focus of this project.</p>

        <div class="subgroup row" id="subgroup-data-requirements" data-title="Data Requirements">

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>Data Requirements</h3>

                <p>PerSE has two data requirements:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Latitude and Longitude in decimal degree format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Date:</strong> A date/time stamp in the Gregorian format.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>PerSE does not anticipate any other incoming data attributes, however the system allows for the user to add additional data attributes. These additional non-required attributes are determined by PerSE to be either numerical or categorical. If numerical the attribute is displayed as an interactive histogram; if categorical the attribute is displayed as an interactive bar plot.</p>

                <p>Additionally, non-required attributes can be specified as two optional data requirements:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Content Attribute:</strong> If provided, it is used to symbolize/color all views within PerSE. If a content Attribute is not provided, data representations (i.e. bars, points, etc.) will be displayed with solid gray.</li>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> If provided, it is used to add detail and other meaningful information to the event. The description is visualized within the Table and on the Voronoi Subplots Map pop-ups.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content col-xs-12">

                <h3>ACLED</h3>

                <p>PerSE currently utilizes the <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project)</a>. The ACLED contains data points which detail reported political violence in developing states. Data point attributes include, event type, actors, associate actors, interaction, fatalities, source, location, location precision, and notes. As event coding can be a complicated and controversial thing, please feel free to check out their <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">website</a> if you have any beef.</p>

                <p>As the <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a> contains >90,000 data points spanning Africa and the Middle East, PerSE uses a subset of this data set to illustrate the potential utility of the tool. The subset currently displayed in PerSE starts 01 JAN 2008 and ends 2013 DEC 2013 in Nigeria and contains 3,296 data points. This data set was chosen because it highlights the complexity in culturally derived periodicity. In the case of Nigeria, the North is distinctly Islamic, and therefore the Islamic (Hijri) calendar is important; the South is distinctly Christian, and therefore the Gregorian calendar is important.</p>

                <p>Although PerSE utilizes the <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>, PerSE does not attempt to be a comprehensive solution for <a href="http://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a> analysis. Important aspects within the data set like actor-to-actor correlations are not explicitly addressed at its current state. Perhaps this would be a useful follow-up project.</p>

        <p class="lead"><a href="index.html">PerSE</a> is 99.9% on the client, and was built with several web development libraries and toolkits.</p>

        <p>PerSE is 99.9% client side programming. In fact, after all dependencies load, the only server request is for map tiles. In the age of <em>Big-Data</em> this may sound unusual, however keep in mind PerSE is a prototype designed and built to advance current research on visual analytics methods for spatio-temporal periodicity. Therefore, the emphasis is placed on the visual components.</p>

                <h3>Modularity</h3>

                <p>The project was written carefully to insure as much modularity as possible. To help with this process development focused on the <a ref="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD">Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)</a> paradigm. At its current state, each view... <p>

                <ul>

                    <li>is given an identical array of data points every time the selection changes.</li>
                    <li>provides a filter function to the data set adapter to filter data points.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Thus, views can be refactored without major dependency issues or moved into other projects. This will be particularly important if operations and processing are offloaded to a server.</p>

        <p class="lead">Some future work include, actor-to-actor correlations, scaling up to a server, irregular interval periodicity.</p>

        <p>At this point in time, I will not be actively developing or extending PerSE. However, I have many future work ideas regarding it. To name a few:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Actor-to-Actor</strong>: How can we visualize this? How can we see who is battling/targeting who? When and Where?</li>
            <li><strong>Verification</strong>: After we find a pattern, how can we verify it with statistical tests?</li>
            <li><strong>Scaling Up</strong>: As mentioned above, everything is done on the client. If we move some or all of the preprocessing to a server we will be able to access larger data sets. However, if we scale up in events, we will need to look into alternative cartographic solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Irregular Patterns</strong>: PerSE was built to answer questions about formal calendar systems (i.e. Gregorian, Islamic, etc). What about patterns that don't fit any calendar system (i.e. 10-day patterns, 21-day patterns)?</li>
            <li><strong>Holiday Support</strong>: Patterns related to a calendar system might be in relation to civic, religious, or cultural holidays. By identifying the root of these patterns we can understand more complex issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Export</strong>: Analysts will most likely want to export data for further analysis. A <em>shoebox</em> extension to the table would be a nice step in that direction.</li>
